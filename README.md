Employee Attrition Prediction

This project focuses on predicting employee attrition using machine learning algorithms. By analyzing patterns in employee data,aim to identify which employees are more likely to leave the organization.
The goal is to help organizations take proactive measures to reduce attrition rates.

Project Overview:-
Employee attrition is a significant issue faced by many organizations.
This project uses an Employee Attrition dataset to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and apply various machine learning algorithms to predict whether an employee is likely to leave (binary classification).
The results are evaluated based on accuracy and other performance metrics, with XGBoost providing the highest accuracy.

Key Features:-
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): A thorough analysis of the dataset to uncover patterns, correlations, and outliers.
Feature Engineering: Transforming the dataset to improve the predictive performance of machine learning models.
Machine Learning Models: Applied various algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest,and XGBoost to predict employee attrition.
Evaluation Metrics: Used accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the model performance, with XGBoost achieving the best accuracy.
Algorithms Used
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
XGBoost (Best Accuracy)
